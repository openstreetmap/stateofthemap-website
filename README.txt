Change the Background Image:
============================

Under 'design' resp. 'appearance' you'll find the options menu 'change background image'. Select the background 
you like most. Save options.



Your custom Background Image:
=============================
1.
Get the image you want. Size it to 1024px height to make it fit also for larger screens. 
JPG-Files with lower quality ensure fast loading times - quality doesn't need to be too high in browsers. 
File size should be under 100 KB in the end. Name it "default.jpg" and copy it to your image into the /images 
folder of the theme. If you want to keep the standard default.jpg, rename it before you copy your image.

2.
Under 'design' resp. 'appearance' you'll find the options menu 'change background image'. Select 'default' and
don't care for the preview thumbnail as it still shows the standard default image. Save options.
